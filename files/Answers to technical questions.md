# Answers to Technical Questions

### Question 1. 
 > How long did you spend on the coding test? What would you add to your solution if you had more time? If you didn't spend much time on the coding test then use this as an opportunity to explain what you would add.

- It took me around 14 hrs to complete this assignment. Being a newbie to the web development world, I am currently trying my handson with all frameworks and learning as much as possible. The most challenging part for me was to understand and code in php since it has been a long while I have done handson with it.
- The tasks seem to be quite easy as I was proceeding and I think I could have completed it with more efficiency if pushed little harder. 
- As an add-on features to the given task, `Creation of a Contact Form` could be assigned to test more of php knowledge.


### Question 2. 
> How would you track down a performance issue in production? Have you ever had to do this?
- Mostly performance issue in prodction are tracked and tackled once the appliction are open for users to use.
- User feedback play major role in tracking production performance.
- Currently working in a small scale work environment has given me all kinds of exposure, right from taking client requirements to developing the product and deploying it on live environment.
- We have been taking client response as a major source of track down for a performance issue in production.
- And once the feedback is received, respective developer can be notified such as
	- Server admin: Server side issue,
	- UI developer: Broken UI,
	- Mismatch in data: Backend Engineer,
and so on.
